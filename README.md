# Flutter WindowsXP

A Flutter project that mimics the Windows XP desktop.

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/winXP) demo made in React.

## Notes

Chrome browser has poor performance in web rendering because of [this bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/105044), 
so it is better to test in other browsers.

Best performance is achieved in native macos app.
